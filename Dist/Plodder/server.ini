[CONFIG]

[WINDOWSEVENTLOG]
write               = ¯1            ; ¯1 = Write Start/Stop/Error events to Windows Event Log under Windows in Runtime; 1: write under Windows; 0=Never

[TRAP]
General             = ¯1        ; ¯1 = Error trapping in RunTime but not otherwise. 1 = Trap; 0 = do not trap. General means "above" Rumba
Rumba               = 1         ; This has an effect only in development. Rumba traps all errors in RunTime in any case.

[APP]
